## Hello! My name is Elena

I am a data science consultant and former PhD student in computational neuroscience at the Department of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.

On this page, I provide code repositories that are mainly related to my work and the publications and experiments of my doctoral thesis. These include signal processing pipelines, machine learning pipelines, and statistical analyses. Since 2020, I have been an enthusiastic Pythonista and am particularly interested in complex time series, data science, and scientific programming. I am also very fond of R.

The publications are linked in the repositories.
