## Hello! My name is Elena

I currently work as a data scientist for both Research Data Services at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) and the University of Zurich (UZH)‑based Linguistic Research Infrastructure (LiRI). I earned my PhD at the Department of Computational Linguistics, UZH, where I focused on bridging neural modelling with language processing.

On this account I provide code repositories that are primarily related to my work and to the publications and experiments from my PhD. These include signal processing pipelines, machine learning pipelines, and statistical analyses; the publications are linked in the repositories.

Since 2020 I have been an enthusiastic Pythonista, and I am also very fond of R. My main interests are scientific programming, data workflows, and research‑data‑management tools.
