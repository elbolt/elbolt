## Hello! My name is Elena

I am a former PhD student in Computational Neuroscience at the Department of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

On this page I provide code repositories mainly related to the publications and experiments of my PhD thesis. These include signal processing pipelines, machine learning pipelines and statistical analysis. I have been a passionate Pythonista since 2020, with a keen interest in complex time series, data science and scientific programming. I am also very fond of R.

The publications are linked in the repositories.
