## Hello! My name is Elena

I am a soon-to-be PhD graduate in Computational Neuroscience within the Department of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich.

On this page, I share code repositories primarily related to the publications from my PhD thesis. These include signal processing pipelines, machine learning pipelines, and statistical analyses. I have been a passionate Pythonista since 2020, with a keen interest in complex time series, data science, and scientific programming. Additionally, I am very fond of R.

The publications—if already available—are linked within the repositories.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or notice anything suspicious. As a continuous learner, I welcome any suggestions for improvement or advice on what I can do better next time.
